## Getting Started

### Install

```bash
npm install https://github.com/kwonhyunjeen/kanbanwave
```

### Sample Code

**Basic `KanbanWave` setup**

```tsx
import { KWStorageProvider, KWStorage } from 'kanbanwave';

function App() {
  const storage: KWStorage = { ... };

  return (
    <KWStorageProvider storage={storage}>
      {children}
    </KWStorageProvider>
  );
}
```

This code sets up the basic environment for using `KanbanWave` and acts as a context provider that injects the user-defined `storage`. The `storage` is an object that defines the API or database interactions with boards, lists, and cards.

**Displaying a List of Boards**

```tsx
import { BoardCollection } from 'kanbanwave';

function BoardList() {
  return <BoardCollection />;
}
```

A component that renders a collection of boards, allowing users to create and manage multiple boards.

**Viewing a specific board**

```tsx
import { BoardView } from 'kanbanwave';

function BoardContent() {
  return <BoardView />;
}
```

A component that displays the lists and cards within a selected board when a specific board is chosen.

## Usage

`KanbanWave` offers a range of features from storage integration to board display, theming, and component customization. You can manage your data by applying custom storage, easily display boards and lists, adjust the theme to fit your project, and customize how components are rendered based on your needs.
